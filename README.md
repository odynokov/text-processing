- Tone analysis gives an idea of how formal or how conversational the text looks. Conversational text uses more pronouns and fewer prepositions, among other differences.
- Sentiment analysis gives an idea of whether the text uses mostly positive language, negative language, or neutral language. For longer pieces, the text is split into three to give sentiment analysis for the beginning, middle and end of the piece.
- Text Composition (parts of speech)
- Keyword Density (1 word, 2 words, 3 words)
- Longest Sentences by Word Count
- Longest Words by Syllable Count
- Longest Words by Letter Count
